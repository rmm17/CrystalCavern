# CrystalCavern

Marble Run game created in Unreal Engine Blueprint for the Udemy "Unreal Engine Blueprint Game Developer" course. 

Tools used: Unreal Engine 4.27.2

Build and compile using Unreal Engine 4.27+.

Apply rotating force to the ball by pressing WASD keys on the keyboard. Avoid cannon projectiles and pick all the crystals in the level. Your health decreases every time the ball is hit by a projectile. If your health reaches zero or you fall off the map, the level is restarted. If you reach the end of the level with all crystals collected, the game transitions to the next level (if it's the last level, the game simply quits). There are currently two levels implemented.
